# Hyperosmotic_Confinement-Jump
Hyperosmotic cell compression leads to a highly compartmentalized cellular space, which confines the diffusion of sub-cellular objects, ranging from HOPS condensates to RNAs and particles. This project aims to quantify both the constrained diffusion and occasional hop diffusion of particles in live cell.
